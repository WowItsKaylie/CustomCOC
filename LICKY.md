I originally showed off my code in dev's discord, including a screenshot of my code.

Licky then asked how to do this and tried to attempt it themselves.

After a LOT of back and forth on their very bad syntax, they eventually got it working. I had to show them videos on how, though.

I thought it was just someone wanting help with their first mod. Innocent practice, right?
Nope! After some hours I noticed that Licky had started a github repository and posted their blatently stolen code in cheat servers with **no attribution whatsoever**.

Obviously this isn't very cool. Also, maybe *don't* write things in your README if they don't even exist yet?

Anyway, hopefully that's enough to prove that this project was started before the other one.
